// front: the one port an app domain exposes (isolation/DESIGN.md section 10). It runs inside the
// domain, beside the app:
//   - mints the domain's TLS key in guest memory at start; the key is never written anywhere;
//   - terminates TLS on the domain's only channel;
//   - answers GET /.well-known/enclave-attestation?nonce=<64 hex> itself;
//   - answers GET /.well-known/enclave-ready: whether the app's port accepts connections yet (ready.go);
//   - proxies everything else, as plaintext on the guest's loopback, to the app (wasmtime serve, or a command
//     that binds its own port), with no X-Forwarded-For (ready.go).
//
// Two shapes, one binary:
//
//	M2, one app per guest: listen on vsock, and ask the hardware for the report directly (-snp).
//	M3, many domains per guest: listen on a unix socket the monitor relays (-listen-unix), and ask the
//	MONITOR for the report (-report-unix). The front then never touches the report interface, and the
//	app half of report_data is written by the monitor from its own table rather than by this process
//	(isolation/m3/PLAN.md section 3).
//
// Under SEV-SNP the report's 64-byte report_data is
//
//	[0:32]  the binding: sha256(transport key SPKI DER || nonce) under ABI/1, or, under ABI/2,
//	        contract.Bind2 over the same key and nonce AND this domain's runtime identity
//	[32:64] sha256 of the app .wasm                    names the app, as M1 did
//
// so a verifier that checks the report against the key ITS OWN handshake saw knows its traffic ends
// inside this measured domain. On T0 there is no hardware report, and the endpoint says so.
//
// ABI/2 (isolation/contract/RUNTIME.md) is used when the image carries a runtime identity beside the
// runtime (-runtime-identity, written by build-domain.sh). The app is a portable WebAssembly component
// compiled INSIDE this domain, so the runtime, its version, its execution mode, the ISA it targets and
// its CPU-feature policy are part of what the report vouches for; runtime.go checks the identity against
// this domain before the front states it, and the front refuses to serve if it cannot. Without that file
// the domain keeps ABI/1 unchanged.
