/* PID 1 of ONE app domain (isolation/m3/PLAN.md). The monitor starts this inside the domain's new
 * mount, PID, network, IPC and UTS namespaces, chrooted to the domain's own directory, and it:
 *   1. mounts the domain's private /proc and /tmp and brings its loopback up (root work, in the
 *      domain's namespaces, before any domain code runs);
 *   2. drops to the domain's unprivileged uid and starts the two workloads: the runtime serving the
 *      app, and the front that terminates TLS and asks the monitor for reports;
 *   3. prints what the domain can see, as evidence for the isolation checks;
 *   4. reaps, and exits when either workload exits, which the monitor treats as the domain ending;
 *   5. on SIGTERM, passes it to the front so the domain winds down gracefully. The monitor signals THIS
 *      process, whose handle it owns, rather than hunting for the front's pid in /proc — a number that
 *      could be recycled between being read and being signalled.
 *
 * EVERY setup step fails closed. A domain whose /proc, /tmp or loopback could not be set up, or whose
 * privilege drop did not complete, exits instead of running the tenant's app in a half-built world;
 * the monitor sees the exit and reclaims the domain.
 *
 * This is the INTERIM backend: what separates one domain from another here is the GUEST KERNEL
 * (namespaces, uids, cgroups), so the guest kernel is in the TCB for app-vs-app isolation. That is
 * WEAKER than the VMPL separation described in PLAN.md section 1, and is not a substitute for it. SNP
 * still excludes the host from all of it.
 *
 * usage: domexec <id> <runtime-uid>:<front-uid> [app|probe|run] [memMiB] [port] (run by the monitor, never by a domain)
 *   The runtime and the front run as DIFFERENT uids (enclave-87's ruling on enclave-bf's finding): the front is the
 *   trusted component in a domain and the runtime is not, so the runtime must not be able to signal, trace or read the
 *   front, replace its listen socket, or reach the report socket (the monitor gives /run to the front's uid alone). The
 *   adversary probe runs as the RUNTIME's uid: it stands in for a compromised runtime.
 *   app   (default) the runtime serving the tenant's app, plus the front
 *   probe the measured adversary probe (domprobe.c) as the domain's only workload, for the isolation
 *         tests: it stands in for a compromised runtime and reports what it could reach
