// monitor: the one privileged component inside an M3 guest (isolation/m3/PLAN.md).
//
// M1 and M2 put one app inside one measured guest, so a verifier learned which app it was talking to
// from the launch measurement alone. M3 puts this monitor inside the measured guest and loads apps into
// it afterwards, which is what a VMPL design would also force (PLAN.md section 3: under IGVM the launch
// measurement covers the monitor and firmware, not the app). So identity moves:
//
//	the hardware signs the report -> the report's measurement names THIS monitor
//	                              -> the monitor names the app it loaded and hashed itself.
//
// Which makes three rules non-negotiable here:
//  1. the monitor is the ONLY holder of the report interface. No domain can see /sys, so no domain can
//     ask the hardware anything directly.
//  2. the app hash in a report comes from the monitor's OWN table, keyed by the kernel credentials of
//     the socket the request arrived on. A domain cannot ask for a report naming another app, because
//     the request has no field in which to say one.
//  3. the host chooses which app to load, but cannot misreport it: the monitor hashes the bytes it
//     received and names that hash.
//
// Two things follow from the monitor being privileged and shared, and both are handled here rather than
// assumed away:
//   - EVERY domain ends exactly once, however it ends. A crashed workload, a killed process tree and an
//     explicit destroy all run the same reclamation, which is idempotent and waits for the processes to
//     be gone before unmounting. A domain that died must not stay in the table, keep its port answering,
//     or hold its mounts and cgroup.
//   - work a domain asks of the monitor is BOUNDED. Callers are authenticated before their bytes are
//     parsed, requests are read under a size cap and a deadline, and reports are admitted under a global
//     and a per-domain limit. Otherwise a domain could move memory and work into the monitor, which runs
//     outside that domain's cgroup, and starve every other domain's reports.
//
// What separates one domain from another in THIS build is the guest kernel: namespaces, a uid and a
// cgroup each (see domexec.c). That is WEAKER than the VMPL separation M3b would give, and it puts the
// guest kernel inside the TCB for app-vs-app isolation — the set of things that must be correct for one
// app to stay protected from another. SNP still excludes the host from all of it.

//	            a guest at VMPL0 holds every VMPCK and can request a report naming a LOWER level, so on its
//	            own this shows nothing about confinement.
//	vmpl0       whether we can obtain a report at level 0 AT ALL. This was documented here as "the one part
//	            that cannot be faked downwards, because our secrets page holds no VMPCK0 unless we really are

//	            refusal is still worth PRINTING - an incoherent tuple is a fault in measured code, and this
//	            monitor still refuses to serve on one - but it does not establish confinement. The SVSM is
//	            identified by the launch measurement; see isolation/DESIGN.md and judge.mjs checkBoundary.
