# points. assemble-app-image.sh adds one app to it; build-app-guest.sh does both; domain-release.sh publishes the
# template so a verifier can reassemble the same image from pinned files instead of from this host's binaries.

# source into this user's cache, compiled with the host's /usr/bin/gcc named explicitly (the image's init bytes are a
# function of both; a change in either fails the install's reproduction gate, closed). Besides musl, the link takes only
# GCC's crtbeginS.o/crtendS.o (GCC Runtime Library Exception). The predictor never rebuilds init: it reads the
