# M4a: build ONE SNP guest that runs exactly ONE app, from a canonical isolation/contract bundle.
#
# Why a guest per app rather than a domain per app (M3a's shape):
#   * app-vs-app separation becomes the SNP GUEST boundary - its own ASID, its own memory-encryption key, its
#     own vCPU state - instead of the guest kernel. That is the strongest separation this hardware offers.
#   * the app's identity is MEASURED. Without IGVM the launch carries kernel-hashes=on, so the initramfs is in
#     the launch measurement. M3b's IGVM path does NOT measure the guest image (isolation/m3/PLAN.md section
#     16), so `report_data[32:64]` there is the app ID as stated by code whose own identity is unestablished.
#     Here the bundle's bytes are inside the measured image, so the AppID's preimage is measured with it.
#
# The app ID is the contract's: sha256 of ALL the bundle's bytes. It is written to /app.sha256, which is
# exactly what the M2 front already puts in report_data[32:64] - so no front change, and the report names the
# AppID rather than a bare artifact hash. The bundle itself is copied in beside the artifact so a verifier's
# expected measurement covers the bytes the ID is taken over.
#
# usage: build-app-guest.sh <app.bundle> <out.cpio.gz> [vcpus=1]
# prints: app_id, the image size and the predicted launch measurement
