# Create an M4a DOMAIN RELEASE: every input of a per-app guest's launch measurement except the app, pinned by one
# id (release-manifest.py). A verifier who holds the release and an app's bundle reconstructs the expected
# measurement without this host's binaries (expected-measurement.sh). Not published anywhere by this script.
#
# WHY. A measurement is a function of the SOURCE REVISION of everything in the image, not only of the app: on
# 2026-09-24 a change that no guest executes (catalog code linked into the front) moved every per-app measurement.
# So "recompute from the bundle" is only meaningful against pinned template bytes.
#
#   usage: domain-release.sh <new release dir>
