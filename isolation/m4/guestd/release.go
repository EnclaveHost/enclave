// The attested release, host side (docs/security/attested-release.md; the guest side is isolation/m2/front/provision.go).
//
// A guest that serves a deployment gets its owner's config and secrets from the relay, sealed to a key only it holds,
// and nothing about them crosses this host. What this host does is carry two things it cannot misuse:
//
//   - the TICKET. The lease holder's supervisor gets it from the relay (it holds the operator key; this host does
//     not) and hands it to guestd; guestd hands it to the ONE guest it launched for that deployment, on vsock host
//     port release.TicketPort. A ticket is useless in any other guest (the relay binds it to a report that guest
//     cannot produce), but it is one-use, so a ticket routed to the wrong guest is BURNED: the service therefore
//     answers a guest only by the vsock CID guestd itself chose for it, and only with that guest's own deployment's
//     ticket. The guest's front refuses a ticket that does not name its HOST_DATA anyway.
//   - the guest's EGRESS, on vsock host port egressPort: TLS the guest runs end to end, to origins the guest's own
//     allowlist names (isolation/m2/egress). This host sees destinations, timing and volume, and records only the
//     guest's CID and an outcome code. It serves only CIDs of guests guestd launched (admitCID).
//
// The ticket arrives in one of two ways: in the create request, or later through POST /vms/<id>/ticket. The second is
// the one a supervisor should use: the guest dials the ticket service as it boots and guestd HOLDS that connection,
// reporting awaitingTicket, so the supervisor fetches the ticket (TTL 120 s at the relay) only once the guest is
// actually waiting, and no part of the TTL is spent building the image. A ticket that never arrives ends the guest:
// the hold times out, the connection closes, the front refuses to start the app, the guest powers off, and the
// launch fails through the lifecycle, returning the guest's reservation (pool.go).
