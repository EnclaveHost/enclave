# Base-enabled SNP images r7 and r8: production runs, 2026-11-02

**Image r7** (`/vm/enclave-volumes/rpc-snp-image-r7`)
- Built from the accepted coverage set `ops/rpc-base-coverage-r1/activation-r4`, including blob-patch.json 8bad515d.
- Measurement (8 vCPU) 51bcd3ae…36dc. It booted, and the front attested.
- **FAILED:** enclave-rpc-identity refused with "Guest runtime changed".
  - The beacon-patch rewrite of chain_service.py (port 15052 -> 15053) changed that file's sha256.
  - identity.json runtimePins still held the original hash, 75c879ec…, so the el, cl and base clients never started.
  - Public L1 was down from 18:35 to 18:49Z.
- **Fix:** build_image.py now re-pins identity.json to the shipped chain_service.py (1c3a7dbc…). It also asserts, inside the build VM, that every runtime pin matches the shipped file.

**Image r8**
- Measurement 059fbeef…0ad0. Identity verified, and L1 and Lighthouse started.
- **Base refused**, because receipts and transactions history from block 48000000 is absent.
  - The disk was downloaded with `--with-*-distance 140000`, so it holds only static files from 52.5M up.
  - chain.json `baseRetention.historyFromBlock` is 48000000.
  - The coverage activation itself passed: it is checked before the history check.
- **Remedy:** `rpc/snp/base_history_backfill.py` adds exactly the 18 receipts and transactions archives for 48.0M–52.0M from the pinned snapshot manifest. Every output's blake3 is checked before it is moved into static_files, and the db is not touched.
- While the backfill runs, the enclave runs r8 with the L1 disk only (`prod-r8-l1.json`), and public L1 is served.

**Gateway:** the control-VM allowlist now accepts measurements b04f… (r6), 51bc… (r7) and 059f… (r8). The backup is `config.attested.json.r6-only`.

**Backfill runs** (work dirs `/vm/enclave-volumes/rpc-base-history-backfill-r{1,2,3}`)
- r1 failed before downloading: getty's vhangup on ttyS0 gave EIO to cloud-init's redirect. It was first misread as an apt lock.
- **r2, 11:57–15:03 MST, FAILED partway.**
  - It installed the 7 transactions archives for 49.0M–52.5M, each blake3-verified.
  - It then refused at receipts-48000000. The `.part` files in `data/.download-cache`, left by the earlier `base snapshot download` attempt, are not zstd ("unsupported format").
  - curl had resumed onto them, so the downloads had the right size but the wrong bytes.
  - Nothing unverified was installed.
- r3 uses the fixed tool (83b844f02):
  - foreign partials are rejected by their zstd magic;
  - an archive that fails extraction or verification is fetched once more;
  - installed archives are skipped;
  - status comes back through a results disk.
  - It has 11 archives left, 104 GB.
