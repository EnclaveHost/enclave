/* ============================================================
   <c-fleet-list> - per-enclave capacity rows (the relay's
   /enclaves table). Assign `.rows` (already sorted upstream) and
   it renders each box as a summary ("$0.10 for 12 GB / 33 tflops of
   GPU", one line a pool) that expands to its full pools, five boxes a
   page. The units in those lines are the sort controls: GB or tflops on
   a GPU line sorts every host by its price per GB of VRAM or per TFLOPS,
   GB or gflops on a CPU line by RAM or CPU compute, the rating (★98%)
   by rating; again reverses. The Sort by bar above the hosts offers
   every order as a dropdown, with the direction beside it.
   Copy says "available",
   never "free": on a page that sells compute, "60 GB free" reads as
   a price, not as headroom.
