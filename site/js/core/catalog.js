/* ============================================================
   App store · on-chain catalog (EnclaveAppCatalog on Base) + IPFS CIDs
   Apps are versioned: keyed by keccak256(publisher, slug), each with an
   append-only list of releases (own CID, label, verified/yank flags).
   Browsing reads the contract via a public RPC eth_call (no wallet).

   This module is the shared READ side + the friendly-ref caches:
   the Apps page renders from it, and the Deploy page resolves
   slug:version references and pre-flights the deploy gate with it.
   Load progress is announced with `enclave:catalog` events (detail.type:
   loading | loaded | error) - pages render, this module doesn't.

/* ---- confirmed writes the read side hasn't caught up to ----
   A moderation transaction (approve / reject / verify / yank / delist) is
   SETTLED the moment its receipt lands: the chain holds the new state. What
   the UI shows next used to be a different question, and often the wrong one.
   The post-tx re-read goes to the rotating pool of public Base RPCs at exactly
   the moment our own receipt polling has been bursting against them, so it
   either fails outright ("catalog refresh failed - showing the last good
   read", the store keeping its PRE-approval paint) or lands on a replica that
   hasn't indexed the block yet and faithfully repaints the old ruling. Either
   way the owner approved a version and watched nothing happen until a manual
   page refresh minutes later.

   So a write whose receipt has landed is recorded here and re-applied over
   every catalog read until a FRESH read agrees with it (the replicas caught
   up - drop it) or it ages out. The receipt is the authority; a lagging
   replica is not evidence against it. Persisted, because the page refresh
   that used to be the workaround must not be the thing that loses the state.
   A read showing a THIRD value (neither ours nor what we overwrote) means the
   chain moved on without us - someone else's later write - and retires the
   entry too; the TTL is only the backstop under that. */
