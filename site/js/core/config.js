/* ---- loopback-only override gate -------------------------------------------
   Two reads below (enclave_addressbook, enclave_rpc) exist ONLY so the e2e
   suite can point the site at its local anvil - there the site is served from
   http://localhost:18899, so gating on the ORIGIN keeps that working while
   making both inert anywhere real.

   Why they need gating at all: a persisted enclave_rpc pins EVERY chain read
   to one endpoint, and js/core/addressbook.js resolves the contract addresses
   over those same reads - so a planted value rewrites DEPLOYMENTS_ADDRESS and
   PAYMENT_ROUTER_ADDRESS, and the wallet then signs create/fund/USDC transfers
   to an attacker's contract. Planting one needs an existing foothold on the
   origin (XSS, a hostile extension, a shared browser), but localStorage
   SURVIVES that foothold being closed: the payload outlives the hole it came
   through. That is the whole reason these two are worth gating and the
   sessionStorage addrbook cache below is not - a per-tab cache dies with the
   tab, and repopulating it needs script execution on the origin all over again.

   Gate on the origin rather than on the value: "is this RPC URL loopback?" can
   be satisfied by a value the attacker picks (a loopback port they got you to
   run), while "is this page on loopback?" cannot be satisfied on
   enclave.host at all. Inert in production no matter what the value says. */
