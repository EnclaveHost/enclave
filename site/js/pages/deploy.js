/* ============================================================
   Deploy flow - the on-chain create+fund+watch sequence behind
   the store's quick-deploy modal (apps.js imports it lazily) and
   the dashboard's retry/resume paths (<c-deployments>). A real
   deploy soft-navigates to the dashboard and streams its
   narrative into its own run (js/core/runlog - <c-deployments>'
   live strips and row Output panels follow it; deploys are
   concurrent, so fleets stream side by side).
   The deploy CONSOLE that used to live in front of this flow is
   gone: an app deploys from its card with one decision (the
   amount), and everything else - config, model volumes,
   protection, relay - is a tab on the deployment's dashboard row.
