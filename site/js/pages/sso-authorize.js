/* ============================================================
   /sso/authorize - Sign in with Enclave for TENANT apps (EST1).

   A tenant app (eyesoff.ai et al) sends a visitor here to reuse
   their enclave.host login. This page authenticates them with the
   relay ACCOUNT session (passkey or wallet SIWE - openSignIn), has
   the relay mint a short-lived, audience-bound EST1 token naming
   the ACCOUNT itself (sub = acct id; the passkey IS the identity,
   relay/sso.js), and returns them to the app with the token in
   the URL fragment. The
   app verifies it inside its own enclave against the published
   signer address; the contract is enclave-apps/eyesoff-ai/
   PLATFORM-sso.md.

   The same invariant as /authorize, for the same reason: the set
   of RETURN ORIGINS is derived from the deployment id alone - its
   canonical <label>.app.enclave.host subdomain plus any custom
   domain the platform has VERIFIED for exactly that deployment
   (/v1/domains/map) - and redirect_uri is honored only if its
   origin is in that set. Otherwise ?aud=<real app>&redirect_uri=
   <attacker> would aim a freshly minted token at an attacker's
   origin. Unlike /authorize the custom-domain origin is allowed
   through (an SSO user should land back on the address they came
   from), which is safe here precisely because the set is built
   from verified ownership rows, never from the parameter.

   `state` is opaque and echoed verbatim: the app refuses a token
   whose state echo does not match the one it stored when it
   started the flow, so a crafted link cannot sign a visitor into
   an account they never chose. Token travels in the FRAGMENT -
   no server log, no Referer.

   A SIGNED-IN visitor passes through with no interaction at all:
   the operator's explicit decision (2026-08-17). Deployments are
   this platform's trust unit, so an app learning a signed-in
   visitor's account id is accepted, not gated on a click. The only
   interaction left is signing in when there is no session.
