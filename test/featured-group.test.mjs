// The featured group at the head of the store's default tab.
//
// It used to be one box in the page header - an aside beside the heading, holding exactly one app.
// Steven asked for it to become the first tab instead: eligible featured apps at the top with the
// gold border, and every other approved app after them. That turns a single-winner pick into an
// ordered group, and the things that can go wrong are all about identity and order:
//
//   - the same app holding two campaigns must appear ONCE;
//   - the order must stay the contract's own ranking (highest bid, ties to the older campaign);
//   - a campaign for an app that is not approved and listed right now must not promote it;
//   - with no standing campaign at all, the editorial fallback must still produce exactly one pick;
//   - and "promoted" must never be said about an app nobody paid for.
