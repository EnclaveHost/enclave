# windows/node: the Windows consumer node

The pieces a Windows 11 machine runs to join the fleet as a `windows-vbs-node` (contract:
`windows/vbs/EVIDENCE.md`). This directory holds the TPM half; the enclave half lives in
`windows/enclave-engine/`, the agent that drives both is `agent.mjs`.

## tpmattest.exe: the TPM half, driven over stdin/stdout

`tpmattest.c` is one MSVC tool (raw TPM 2.0 commands through TBS, no TSS) that the agent spawns
once per session and talks to line by line. Build with `build-tpmattest.cmd` (vcvars64 + `cl`,
links `tbs.lib bcrypt.lib ncrypt.lib crypt32.lib`). Run it elevated: `Tbsi_Get_OwnerAuth` (the
endorsement hierarchy's auth value, which Windows set at provisioning) is administrator-only.

At startup the tool opens TBS and creates the quoting key (AIK): `TPM2_CreatePrimary` in the NULL
hierarchy, RSA-2048, `fixedTPM|fixedParent|sensitiveDataOrigin|userWithAuth|restricted|sign`,
RSASSA/SHA-256. The key stays loaded for the life of the process (it is ephemeral: a new one per
process, gone at reboot), so `keys`, `activate` and `quote` all refer to the same key. It prints
`ready tpmattest/1` and then waits for commands.

### Grammar

One command per line on stdin. Every reply is zero or more `<key> <value...>` lines followed by
exactly one terminator, `ok` or `err <step> <detail>`; the agent reads until the terminator. Byte
strings are lowercase hex (the agent base64s them for the tunnel).

| command | reply lines |
|---|---|
| `keys` | `ek-cert <hex DER>`, `ek-cert-source nv:0x01c00002 \| ncrypt:PCP_EKCERT \| none`, `aik-pub <hex TPMT_PUBLIC>`, `aik-name <hex 34 bytes = 0x000b \|\| sha256(TPMT_PUBLIC)>`; informational `ek-cert-nv-failed ...` / `ek-cert-store ...` lines when the TCG NV index is absent and the certificate came from Windows' EK cert store |
| `activate <credentialBlob hex> <secret hex>` | `endorsement-auth windows:<n>-bytes \| empty`, `ek-pub <hex TPMT_PUBLIC>`, `ek-name <hex>`, `ek-source createprimary:endorsement \| persistent:0x81010001`, `ek-cert-match yes \| no \| unknown`, `policy-hmac empty \| computed`, `credential <hex>` (the bytes ActivateCredential recovered) |
| `quote <extraData hex, 1..64 bytes>` | `attest <hex TPMS_ATTEST>`, `sig <hex 256-byte RSASSA-PKCS1v15-SHA256>`, `sig-scheme 0x0014 0x000b`, `aik-pub <hex>`; PCR selection sha256 {0, 7, 12, 13, 14} |
| `pcr <n>` | `pcr <n> <hex sha256 value>` read live |
| `log` | `log <path>` of the newest `C:\Windows\Logs\MeasuredBoot\*.log` (the current boot) |
| `quit` | `ok`, the AIK is flushed, exit 0 (EOF does the same) |

`err` details are `tpm-rc=0x<TPM_RC>` (the TPM's response code, with the session/parameter
number encoded as the spec does), `tbs=0x<TBS_RESULT>`, or a short text.

`activate` is handshake step 5's credential activation: it loads the EK with the TCG EK
Credential Profile default RSA-2048 template under `TPM_RH_ENDORSEMENT` (falling back to the
persistent handle 0x81010001 that Windows keeps), refuses to continue unless that key's modulus is
the one in the EK certificate, opens a policy session, runs `TPM2_PolicySecret` against the
endorsement hierarchy with the auth from `Tbsi_Get_OwnerAuth(TBS_OWNERAUTH_TYPE_ENDORSEMENT_20)`
(empty password if Windows has none), then `TPM2_ActivateCredential(AIK, EK)`. Every handle it
creates is flushed before the reply.

The credentialBlob/secret pair is what `windows/vbs/tools/makecredential.py` (the verifier's
`TPM2_MakeCredential` reference, pure Python) produces from the EK certificate and the AIK name.
`windows/vbs/tools/credential_roundtrip.py` drives the whole exchange against the tool and is the
proof recorded in `windows/vbs/evidence/credential-roundtrip.txt`.

## agent.mjs: the node

`node agent.mjs` (Node 22+, `npm install` for `ws`) runs the three processes and the fleet tunnel:
the Vulkan worker (`shielded-worker.exe`, untrusted GPU half), the enclave host (`ee-host.exe` +
`ee-engine.dll` from `windows/enclave-engine`, the trusted half in VTL1) and `tpmattest.exe`, then
dials `RELAY_URL` and attaches by evidence exactly as `windows/vbs/EVIDENCE.md` describes (keys ->
credential -> transcript/report/quote/log -> attest -> hello). Over the tunnel it answers
`/availability` (`role windows-vbs-node`, `teeCpu windows-vbs-enclave`, shares 0 so no deployment is
placed on it), `/v1/health` and `POST /v1/completions` (`{prompt, max_tokens}`; greedy; the reply
carries the enclave's offload counters). `LOCAL_HTTP_PORT=9600` serves the same surface on loopback
for tests; `RELAY_URL=none` skips the tunnel. Configuration is by environment: see
`node-config.example.cmd`; `install-node.cmd <config>` registers a logon task (elevated, interactive
session) that starts it.

Proven on the NucBox K11 (2026-09-21): worker up in 6 s, enclave up in 12 s, TPM ready, a completion
through the agent = ` Paris. It is the largest city in` with 657 nodes offloaded and 0 verification
failures, the same text the enclave alone and the Linux reference produce.
