// windows/node/apptls.mjs -- the app's OWN hostname, with a real certificate.
//
// A deployment is reachable two ways. `https://api.enclave.host/x/<id>/…` is the platform's API
// path, which the relay terminates. `https://<label>.app.enclave.host/` is the app's own origin,
// and that one is an SNI PASSTHROUGH: relay/relay.js reads the ClientHello, never terminates it,
// and splices the raw bytes to the box holding the lease over a WebSocket at /x/<id>/https. So the
// handshake has to be answered HERE, with a certificate for that name, or a browser lands on a
// warning - which is exactly what the console's open padlock means: it stays amber until a probe
// from the browser itself completes a real handshake.
//
// This module is the certificate half: a P-256 key, a PKCS#10 request for it, and the relay's
// issuance route (relay/certs.js), which issues for the platform's own zones to whichever box
// holds the deployment's live lease, authorized by the operator signature that the registry entry
// names. No certificate authority account, no DNS credentials and no fleet secret on this box.
//
// WHERE THE KEY LIVES, stated because it is the one thing here that is weaker than the platform's
// own boxes: in this process, in VTL0, not in the enclave. A confidential VM mints its app-zone
// key inside the measured guest, so the machine's operator cannot read the app's TLS session. Here
// the operator can, and so can anything with administrator rights on this PC. That matches what
// this box already publishes about app traffic (`apps.traffic: "carried by the host"`) - the /x/
// path is carried in the clear by this same process - and it is reported in /availability as
// appTls.keyIn so nobody has to infer it. Moving it into VTL1 needs a TLS server inside the
// enclave and is the next piece of work, not a line of copy.
