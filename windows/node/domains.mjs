// windows/node/domains.mjs -- the hostnames a customer attached to a deployment this box runs.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. An owner can point their own domain at a deployment: they attach it on the
// dashboard, prove the DNS, and the relay's domain store records it. From then on the app should
// answer on that name with a certificate a browser trusts. The relay's SNI front door already
// routes it (relay/relay.js customDomains -> deployment id -> whichever enclave holds the lease,
// which is this box), so what remains is for the lease holder to LEARN the names, get certificates
// for them, and answer for them. This file is the learning half.
//
// AUTHENTICATION, and why this box can do it at all. relay/domains.js handleFetch takes two
// factors and opens on EITHER: a fleet HMAC over "<id>:<endpoint>:<ts>", or a personal_sign over
// the same tuple by the operator key that REGISTERED this endpoint on chain. Byte for byte the
// secrets fetch (see secrets.mjs for why this box must never hold the fleet key - that key family
// also authorizes _acme-challenge pushes for every hostname on the platform). We send the operator
// factor only. What SCOPES the answer is the ledger: the relay serves a deployment only while its
// live lease `runner` equals keccak256(endpoint), so `endpoint` must be the exact string this box
// registered.
//
// FAILURE BEHAVIOUR IS THE INTERESTING PART, and it is mirrored from the platform runner
// (supervisor.js fetchDepDomains) because getting it wrong takes a paying customer's site down:
//
//   * 503 (a relay without the feature) and 404 (the deployment is not on its ledger view) are
//     AUTHORITATIVE "no custom domains". They clear the list.
//   * anything else - a timeout, a 5xx, a wire error - KEEPS THE LAST KNOWN LIST. A relay blip
//     must not withdraw a live customer's certificate or stop their app answering on their name.
//     This is the opposite of the secrets fetch, where a refusal throws, and deliberately so:
//     there, launching without secrets is a silent misconfiguration; here, forgetting a hostname
//     is an outage on a name the customer owns.
//
// The ISSUANCE REPORT rides along on the next fetch: the box says what happened to each name it
// tried, and the relay shows it to the customer. It is the only way somebody learns that a CA
// refused their domain, so a report that fails to send is retried rather than dropped.

const FETCH_SKEW_SEC = 300;          // relay/domains.js FETCH_SKEW_SEC
const TIMEOUT_MS = 5000;
// relay/domains.js's own hostname filter, re-checked here rather than trusted: this list decides
// which names this box will ask a CA to certify and will answer TLS for, and the relay is not the
// authority for what this box does with its own key.
// A dot is required, and so is the entry being a STRING. Both were found by the test rather than
// by reading: `String(42)` is "42" and `String(null)` is "null", and both sail through a character
// class - so a relay answering with a number would have this box ask a CA to certify "42". The dot
// is not pedantry either: no public CA will issue for a single-label name, so accepting one only
// buys a failed order and a report the customer cannot act on.

 * The custom hostnames attached to one deployment, with the platform's failure semantics.

 * reached - the caller passes its own record rather than this module keeping a cache, so there is
 * exactly one copy of the truth and it lives with the lease.
 *
 * `report` is an array of {hostname, ...status} to deliver; the caller clears what was delivered
 * on a successful fetch (`delivered` in the result says which).
