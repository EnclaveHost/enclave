// the minimum-spec numbers and the default price, so being listed here cannot take a feature away

// masked activations. An artifact built for a world the enclave cannot serve is refused by name

  /**
   * An OPERATOR-SET artifact override: ENCLAVE_APP_ARTIFACT_PATCH = {"<deployment id>":
   * {"file": "<path>", "sha256": "<hex>"}}. The deployment runs that file instead of its catalog
   * version's CID.
   *
   * It exists for one case: a fix whose permanent form needs signatures this box does not hold.
   * risc-box's catalog app and the deployment both belong to the governance hardware wallet, so a
   * fixed build can only become the catalog's version, and the deployment's, through two signatures
   * on that device (publishVersion, then setAppRef). Until then the override is how the fix runs.
   *
   * The bytes are pinned by hash - a file that does not match is refused, never run - and the
   * compiled cache is keyed by that hash, so it cannot be confused with the catalog CID's. Every
   * apply is logged and recorded on the deployment, and the list lives in windows/PARITY.md. It is a
   * WORKAROUND and must be removed once the signed version exists.
