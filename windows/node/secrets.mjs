// windows/node/secrets.mjs -- the relay-staged per-deployment secrets for the app this box holds
// the lease on, fetched with the only key this box has any business holding.
//
// WHAT THESE ARE. An owner stages env-var-shaped private values (S3 keys, API tokens) on the
// api-relay instead of in the deployment's config, because the catalog config and the options
// envelope are both on chain and world-readable by design; relay/secrets.js carries the whole
// trust model, including the part a buyer is owed: the relay operator CAN read them, the chain and
// other tenants cannot. The lease holder pulls the current snapshot right before it starts the app
// and hands the values in as guest env vars. This file is that pull and nothing else: it returns a
// {NAME: value} map and never starts an app, writes a file or keeps a cache.
//
// HOW THIS BOX AUTHENTICATES, and why it is deliberately not how the fleet does it. The relay's
// fetch route takes two factors and opens on EITHER one:
//   * a fleet HMAC over "<id>:<endpoint>:<ts>", derived from the fleet SECRET, which on its own
//     proves only "a holder of the fleet key" and not "this endpoint";
//   * a personal_sign over the SAME tuple by the operator key that REGISTERED this endpoint on
//     chain, which the relay checks against the registry entry and which is per-box.
// We send the second only, and this box must never be given the first: that same derived-key
// family authorizes dns-relay's _acme-challenge TXT pushes, so a holder of the fleet key can
// obtain a CA certificate for every deployment hostname on the platform. On a consumer PC that key
// would live in a file in VTL0, where the enclave boundary does not protect it -- relay/secrets.js
// says so at the line, and calls the operator factor the stronger of the two anyway. What actually
// scopes the answer is the ledger: the relay only serves a deployment whose live lease `runner`
// equals keccak256(endpoint), so `endpoint` here must be the EXACT string this box registered
// (chain.mjs enclaveIdOf), not a prettier spelling of the same URL.
//
// WHY A REFUSAL IS NOT AN EMPTY RESULT. "No secrets staged" and "this box was refused" both end
// with the app running and its $NAME placeholders unresolved, and from inside the guest the two are
// indistinguishable -- that ambiguity cost the platform a two-day investigation pointed at egress
// (supervisor.js fetchDepSecrets, relay/secrets.js log pair). So an empty snapshot returns
// {env:{}, count:0} and a refusal THROWS with the relay's own reason in it. This is the one place
// we do not mirror the platform runner: its fetch never blocks a launch because it has a warm
// per-process cache and a fleet of boxes that have run the deployment before. This box has neither,
// so host.mjs gets to decide, with the reason in hand, whether to launch or hand the lease back.
//
// Values never reach a log line or an error message here, only NAMES and byte counts: a log on this
// box is readable by whoever holds the machine, and an error string ends up on /v1/deployments.

// The relay's own bounds, spelled here so a refusal can name the suspect. FETCH_SKEW_SEC is why a
// box with a wrong clock is refused rather than served, and this is the only refusal an operator
// fixes by looking at their own machine instead of the chain.

// (apprun.mjs serveArgs) or by the enclave's "K=V\0K=V\0\0" env block (EnclaveApp), and a name

// fleet does not: it adds ENCLAVE_INFERENCE_URL (apprun.mjs appEnv), the loopback address of the
