# Owned RPC lifecycle primitives

These sources are unfinished and are not loaded by the host manager or installed
as services. They do not admit or start a VM. The production activation gate stays
closed until the native worker, independent guardian, durable provider-operation
journal, protected namespace, storage attachment and resource admission pass.

`BoundedWorker.cs` is a C# 5 / 64-bit Windows candidate for running one trusted,
pinned observation or submission worker. It creates an unnamed Job Object with
commit-memory, active-process and CPU-affinity limits and kill-on-last-handle-close.
The process enters that job at creation through `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_JOB_LIST`,
before its suspended first thread is resumed. There is no create-then-assign
fallback and no inherited job handle. This avoids leaving a suspended process
outside containment if the supervisor dies during setup.

The primitive uses held process handles and creation time, never a PID lookup for
termination. Normal completion also terminates leftover descendants. A termination
request is followed by an exact process wait and an empty-job observation; timeout
or cleanup failure is reported without claiming death. The caller must keep a
reservation on any uncertain result. Job memory is Windows committed memory, not
an assertion about resident memory or pagefile policy.

Dispatch passes an absolute same-boot monotonic deadline with at most 30 seconds
remaining, capped by the original immutable lifecycle deadline. The worker does
not restart that budget after setup or process creation. The trusted child must
also check its bound contract deadline immediately before submitting any provider
operation. `LocalSuccess` requires known creation/exit identity, exit code zero,
no timeout/failure, observed process exit and an empty job, and confirmed handle
cleanup. A default exit-code field is never a success receipt. Local success still
does not establish a provider fence or VM readiness.

Disposable Windows CI run41137680341 at source f5bb2df8ff8d9967068ca5f5909bef1719761904
compiled successfully and passed all eight inert cases in 2.706 seconds. Cases
cover normal/distinct exit, timeout, memory refusal, descendant cleanup, supervisor
death, invalid executable and expired deadline. The original five-pass/one-fail
run is retained: its fixture incorrectly required a nonzero kill-on-close code.
The corrected fixture observed exact child death at95ms, before natural deadlines.
This is not production-host qualification. Native setup failure paths, target-host
nested jobs and independent guardian integration remain unqualified. It is a low-level trusted primitive, not an authorization boundary:
the caller must independently pin the executable, arguments, environment,
directory, script/module closure and protected ancestor namespace. No production
caller is wired to it. An independent supervisor must bound the primitive itself,
including setup and native calls; its internal stopwatch alone does not prove
those native calls cannot hang. Fresh whole-host admission is required before
even the inert native qualification run.

Killing a local worker does **not** cancel a Hyper-V operation already accepted by
VMMS. Both `ProviderOperationFenced` and `ReservationMayRelease` always return false.
The production protocol needs an exclusive durable start intent before submission,
the exact returned provider operation persisted before acknowledgment, an
independent deadline owner, and a closed start gate. Lost submission responses stay
ambiguous and must never trigger automatic retry. Only settled native operations,
fenced workers and a subsequent original-owned Off/zero-memory observation can
contribute to a release decision; storage writer/export fencing is separate.

Native qualification must cover normal exit, a hung worker, descendants left after
parent exit, supervisor death before resume and during execution, memory exhaustion,
failed job setup, unsupported job-list attributes, nested job restrictions and
forced cleanup failure. It must use inert processes only, independently verify
death, preserve failed evidence and respect a reviewed aggregate resource bound.
No VM, WMI/CIM state-change call, production disk or production credential belongs
in those cases.

## Supervisor envelope (hosted CI only)

`EnterSupervisorEnvelope` optionally applies a one-shot private job to the current
process before any `Run` attempt. It retains the noninheritable job handle until
process teardown; there is no detach, close or retry operation. Limits and exact
self membership are checked after assignment. Any failed envelope permanently
blocks subsequent `Run` calls in that process. The fixed choices are128MiB or
256MiB committed-memory limit, four processes including the caller, and CPU1
placement. This is not a CPU-time quota. Descendant jobs consume the same parent
aggregate; their caps must not be counted twice.

The current private-memory snapshot must be at most64MiB before assignment. This
is neither a startup peak measurement nor a hard bound on earlier allocations.
[Microsoft documents that assignment does not examine earlier memory operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/jobapi2/nf-jobapi2-assignprocesstojobobject).
A separate bootstrap reservation and external deadline owner remain necessary.
The candidate does not solve observer-loss termination or provider settlement.
A separate observer job cannot kill an independently scheduled owner merely by
exiting. Task Scheduler duration settings are a potential backstop, not an exact
process-death receipt or a memory limit.

CI run41138722624 at cbe3ac565d6f3e3fc40a37f0c84839b609491fdc passed all11 cases:
eight existing cases inside a256MiB supervisor job plus membership/readback,
one-shot refusal and failed-entry work-gate checks. The observed bootstrap private
snapshot was12488704B; the harness completed in2.956s. Its inner128MiB allocation
test does not behaviorally prove exhaustion of the outer256MiB cap. This is hosted
CI evidence, not target-host or independent guardian qualification.
