/* ============================================================
   The supported launcher: WMI on the Hyper-V role, defining a TYPE-1 (VBS) partition.

   THE REFERENCE IS THE RECIPE THAT BOOTED AND SERVED on nucbox-k11 (2026-09-25):
   windows/vbslike/ops/uefi-dev-boot.ps1 at e0de58cf on windows/custom-vbs-like-hyperv, its
   `if ($IsolationType -eq 1)` branch, with the reason for every step in
   windows/vbslike/evidence/type1-isolation-2026-09-25.md. It defines the VM with petri's
   `New-CustomVM` (Microsoft's own OpenHCL test harness, openvmm petri/src/vm/hyperv/hyperv.psm1,
   PINNED BY HASH) in ONE DefineSystem call that carries GuestStateIsolationType 1,
   GuestFeatureSet 0x201 and FirmwareFile together, then removes the NICs, opts the GUEST out of its
   own VBS, attaches a medium or none, sends COM1 to a named pipe and reads every one of those back.

   WHAT IT REPLACES, AND WHY. This file used to follow openhcl/Set-OpenHCL-HyperV-VM.ps1: New-VM,
   then GuestFeatureSet + FirmwareFile written on afterwards through ModifySystemSettings. On this
   host a VM made that way never started as type 1 ("A New-VM VM patched afterwards through
   ModifySystemSettings is NOT the same thing, and it never started" - the evidence doc). So there is
   no New-VM here and no ModifySystemSettings firmware pin: the definition is the recipe's, whole.

   Every PowerShell fragment is produced by a pure function so it can be read and tested without a
   host. `run` is injected: production passes a real PowerShell runner, tests pass recorded answers.
   Nothing in this file executes anything by itself, and NONE OF IT HAS RUN ON HYPER-V: the recipe
   ran on the box; this port of it has only run against the fakes in the tests.

   THREE RULES IT KEEPS.

   Preflight refuses rather than improvises. If the Hyper-V role is absent, the namespace is missing,
   the module has no Get-VM, the pinned hyperv.psm1 or the guest-state master is not there, or the
   host's AllowFirmwareLoadFromFile opt-in is not set, `start` fails before it creates anything. The
   opt-in is REPORTED, never touched: see FIRMWARE_OPT_IN.

   Ownership is scoped by construction. Every VM this creates is named with the instance prefix and
   carries a Notes marker (with the deployment's identity), and teardown filters on BOTH. It never
   enumerates VMs for action by any other criterion, so a machine that also runs somebody else's VMs
   is not at risk from this code. A failure after the VM exists removes it BY ITS ID.

   The image is pinned by hash, checked on the host immediately before it is handed to the VM, and
   hashed AGAIN inside the script that defines the VM. A path is not an identity; two runs must be
   able to prove they booted the same bytes.
   ============================================================ */

/*  THE VM MUST BE CREATED WITH A GUEST-STATE ISOLATION TYPE, or FirmwareFile is inert.
 *
 *  Measured on nucbox-k11 2026-09-24: a Generation 2 VM created WITHOUT a guest-state isolation type
 *  accepts a firmware file, reads it back, starts, and boots nothing - no paravisor, so nothing
 *  consumes the field. Created WITH one, the worker actually tries, and says what it wants
 *  (Worker-Admin event 5142):
 *      failed to load custom IGVM file because AllowFirmwareLoadFromFile registry key is not set
 *
 *  So the two are independent: the VM definition decides whether our image is CONSIDERED, the host
 *  registry value decides whether it is ALLOWED. New-CustomVM carries the type in the definition
 *  itself (GuestStateIsolationType 1); the registry value is the host's, and this file only reads it.

   *  - the IGVM is hashed again here, at define time, not only by the earlier imageHash.
   *  - the guest state is a FRESH COPY of the master per run, compared to the master's hash: the
   *    store is written during boot, so a shared one makes every run start from a previous run's
   *    state. The master is never handed to a VM.
   *  - New-CustomVM with GuestStateIsolationEnabled/Type 1/Mode 0, the IGVM, the run copy,
   *    TpmEnabled, Secure Boot off, COM1, memory and vCPUs - in ONE DefineSystem, as petri does.
   *  - NO VTL2 trio (-IncreaseVtl2Memory): petri sets it only for non-isolated VMs, and the type-1
   *    image is fixed-GPA; asking it to auto-place VTL2 was the bare Worker 12030.
   *  - the Notes (our identity) go on FIRST, before anything else that can fail, so the VM is never
   *    one a marker-scoped teardown cannot see.
   *  - READ BACK: GuestStateIsolationType 1, enabled, GuestFeatureSet 0x201, VTL2 mode 0,
   *    FirmwareFile, and the guest-state file (the run copy, never the master). Any mismatch throws.
   *  - NICs removed, and the count read back as zero: this guest has no NIC.
   *  - Set-VMSecurity -VirtualizationBasedSecurityOptOut, read back. REQUIRED on this host: without it
   *    OpenHCL fails "cannot safely support VTL 1 without using the alias map". It declines Guest VSM
   *    (VTL1 INSIDE the guest), which our guest never uses; the partition's isolation is untouched.
   *  - icacls read grants for the VM's own SID on the IGVM (and the medium), exit codes checked: a VM
   *    that cannot read its firmware fails with no content at all.
   *  - uefi-medium: a SCSI controller (New-CustomVM makes none) and ONE DVD, hashed AT ATTACH TIME
   *    from the path the VM is actually pointed at, and set as the first boot device.
   *    linux-direct: nothing attached, and read back as no DVD and no disk.
   *  - COM1 to our named pipe, read back.
   *  - Secure Boot read back Off, one boot entry for uefi-medium, no LoadOptions on any entry.
